# MonoDepthDefocus (Bachelor's Thesis)

Aim is to enable the graded blurring of an image based on how far a point is from focus using just a single image with no extra data. This is achieved by generating a depth map for the image using machine learning. Blurred versions of the image is be created in levels based on how far a point is from the depth of focus. Stitching the different blurred images will create the final image with the selected point fully focussed and points further away become more blurred.
